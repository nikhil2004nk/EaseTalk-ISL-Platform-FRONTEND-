# EaseTalk-ISL-Platform-FRONTEND-Only
Its a project which I made in 24hr Hackathon.
Its a frontend of website which is built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
It contains hompage and various other pages based on feature selection.
when you login to website navigation bar will appear which will lead to different feature which websites offer users.
